Ascii Homes
Problem Description
You are required to develop a program that generates and displays several ASCII art houses with different sizes and orientations, ensuring they are aligned neatly side by side along a common base level.

Each house is represented using ASCII characters /, \, @, &, and #.
The house consists of a roof (formed by slashes) and walls (formed by @ and & representing the left and right walls), ending with a base (#).
The input consists of multiple specifications in the form <length>x<height><direction>, where:
          length -> width of the house

          height -> height of the walls

          direction -> orientation of the house (H,U, D, L, or R)

Depending on the direction:
          H -> No tilting, visualize the house as it is

          U -> Tilt the house upwards

          D -> Tilt the house downwards

          L -> Tilt left (mirror reflection along the left)

          R -> Tilt right (mirror reflection along the right)

All houses are padded and aligned such that their bases lie on the same level, appearing seamlessly side by side without any gaps between the houses.
A 2x4 home looks like below.
